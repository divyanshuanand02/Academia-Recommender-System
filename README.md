## Academia-Recommender-System
This project depicts the integration of android application with Machine learning based recommender system algorithms connected to it backend.The main goal of this project 
is to build a system, which aids a user in finding research paper,journals or articles of interest to her from the first use of the system, at which point the
system does not know the userâ€™s preferences. The system should also collect application consumption data to base future studies on and to recommend stuffs. The solution 
preferably consist of a recommender system and possibly other filtering solutions.

### Motivation
There are several challenges awaiting future development of mobile application recommender systems. It is usually considered not a clever idea to integrate recommender system 
with android platform. Some challenges are common to all recommender systems research, and some specifically tied to either context-awareness or applications as
items.
