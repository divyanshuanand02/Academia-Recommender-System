    "title": "Chinese unknown word identification as known word tagging",
    "abstract": "This work presents a tagging approach to Chinese unknown word identification based on lexicalized hidden Markov models (LHMMs). In this work, Chinese unknown word identification is represented as a tagging task on a sequence of known words by introducing word-formation patterns and part-of-speech. Based on the lexicalized HMMs, a statistical tagger is further developed to assign each known word an appropriate tag that indicates its pattern in forming a word and the part-of-speech of the formed word. The experimental results on the Peking University corpus indicate that the use of lexicalization technique and the introduction of part-of-speech are helpful to unknown word identification. The experiment on the SIGHAN-PK open test data also shows that our system can achieve state-of-art performance.",
